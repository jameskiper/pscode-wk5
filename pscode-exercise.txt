// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
veriables are n1 and n2
n1 + n2 
 =sum 
(Your pseudocode here)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
 IF (n % 2==0) 
   Print even
  IF ( n % 2 != 0)
  Print ("Odd")
 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


calculate numbers n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

min = n1
max = n5
 for  n from n1-n5
   If cur > max
      max = cur 
   If cur < min 
       min = cur 
Print avg
Print min
Print max
